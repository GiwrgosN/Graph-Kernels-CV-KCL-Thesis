# Graph-Kernels-CV-KCL-Thesis
An unsupervised approach to image segmentation in computer vision using graph kernels


This repository includes a collection of Python code used for the completion of a Master's thesis at King's College London for the MSc Data Science program during the academic year 2022-2023. The file included are:

-- Canny - Hyperparameter Tuning.ipynb: Script for Hyper-Parameter Tuning of Canny Edge Detector Algorithm.
-- Main-Results on Validation Set.ipynb: Script that includes the comparison of different graph kernels as well as the comparison of the suggested approach with 
other commonly used apporaches.
-- Ncuts - Hyperparameter Tuning.ipynb: Script for Hyper-Parameter Tuning of Ncuts Algorithm.
-- Propagation Kernel - Hyperparameter Tuning.ipynb: Script for Hyper-Parameter Tuning of Propagation kernel.
-- WL - Hyperparameter Tuning.ipynb: Script for Hyper-Parameter Tuning of Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel.
