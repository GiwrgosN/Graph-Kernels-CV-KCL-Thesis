# Graph-Kernels-CV-KCL-Thesis
An unsupervised approach to image segmentation in computer vision using graph kernels


This repository includes a collection of Python code used for the completion of a Master's thesis at King's College London for the MSc Data Science program during the academic year 2022-2023. The files included are:

- **Canny - Hyperparameter Tuning.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook for hyperparameter tuning of Canny Edge Detector algorithm.
- **Main-Results on Validation Set.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook that includes the comparison of different graph kernels as well as the comparison of the suggested approach with 
other commonly used apporaches.
- **Ncuts - Hyperparameter Tuning.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook for hyperparameter tuning of Ncuts algorithm.
- **Propagation Kernel - Hyperparameter Tuning.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook for hyperparameter tuning of Propagation kernel.
- **WL - Hyperparameter Tuning.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook for hyperparameter tuning of Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel.

The data used in the current thesis are taken from the Berkeley 500 image segmentation dataset: https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html

In order to replicate the results, the file **requirement.txt** can be used in order to create a Python environment.
